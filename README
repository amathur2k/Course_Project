run_analysis.R
--------------
Please source "run_analysis.R" from the UCI HAr DataSet directory. It refers to the data from this directory. It has been tested for windows systems.

I have chosen to get all the variables names from features.txt and set them as the data column headers. This makes it easier to select the right columns for Step 2(Mean / STD). However in order to make the variables as acceptable column headers, i had to use make.names which converts all () to .. thus while searching for mean and std i have got all variables which include the text mean and std such as fBodyAcc.meanFreq().Z 
Hence the total number of variables is higher (86), as per David's comment on the forum this is an acceptable solution.

This file contains a very simple description of all Variables produced at the end of the run. It has been generated programatically
